# Introduction

Standardising development practices improves quality, maintainability and enables easier collaboration between teams.

These guidelines will ensure that all deliverables follow accepted design, security and governance models, thereby raising the bar on engineering quality across the organisation.

## When to use these guidelines

All software development in UKHSA **MUST** follow these guidelines unless explicit exceptions are agreed and documented.

## How to read the guidelines

The following words throughout these guidelines have special meaning as defined in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and copied below with some small edits to contextualise for UKHSA.

> 1. **MUST**: This word, or the terms **REQUIRED** or **SHALL**, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement.
>
> 1. **MUST NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase **SHALL NOT**, mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition.
>
> 1. **SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective **RECOMMENDED**, mean that there **MAY** exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications **MUST** be understood, carefully weighed, justified, and documented before choosing a different course.
>
> 1. **SHOULD NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase **NOT RECOMMENDED** mean that there **MAY** exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications **SHOULD** be understood and the case carefully weighed, justified, and documented before implementing any behavior described with this label.
>
> 1. **MAY**: This word, or the adjective **OPTIONAL**, mean that an item is truly optional. One team **MAY** choose to include the item because a particular context requires it or because they feel that it enhances the solution while another team **MAY** omit the same item.
