# Measuring Security Maturity

## Introduction

Measuring security maturity helps teams understand their current posture and identify areas for improvement. Regular assessments support continuous improvement and help prioritise investment in security capabilities.

## Guidance

- Teams **MUST** complete a quarterly security self-assessment.
- Maturity indicators **SHOULD** be tracked using NIST SSDF, NCSC CAF, and MVSP frameworks.
- Results **MAY** be used to inform training, tooling, or process improvements.
