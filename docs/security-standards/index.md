# Introduction

## Purpose

This guidance defines the security expectations for software engineering teams at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). It is intended to ensure that all digital services are developed in a secure, consistent, and compliant manner, aligned with UKHSAâ€™s strategic objectives and national cybersecurity standards.

The guidance supports the implementation of secure-by-design principles and complements the UKHSA Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It provides a framework for embedding security throughout the software delivery process, from design through to deployment and maintenance.

## Scope

This guidance applies to all software engineering teams delivering digital services within UKHSA, including internal development teams, contractors, and third-party suppliers. It is relevant to all stages of the software lifecycle and all technology stacks used within the organisation.

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- Software engineers and developers
- Technical architects and engineering leads
- Product managers and delivery leads
- Security champions and assurance professionals

## Relationship to the SDLC

This guidance is designed to be used in conjunction with the UKHSA Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It does not duplicate SDLC content but references it where relevant to reinforce secure engineering practices.

## Terminology and Conventions

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119:

- MUST: This requirement is mandatory.
- MUST NOT: This action is explicitly prohibited.
