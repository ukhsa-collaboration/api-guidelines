# 1. Security Principles

## Introduction
Security principles form the foundation of secure software engineering. They guide how teams think about risk, design systems, and make decisions throughout the delivery lifecycle. These principles ensure that security is not an afterthought but a core part of how UKHSA builds and operates digital services.

## Guidance
- All software developed at UKHSA MUST be secure by design.
- Security MUST be considered at every SDLC phase.
- Teams SHOULD adopt a defence-in-depth approach.
- Security MUST NOT be treated as a post-development activity.
- Security controls SHOULD align with OWASP ASVS and NIST SSDF principles.
